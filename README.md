## My process

### Built with

- Vue.js
- Flexbox

### What I learned

The project served me to remember my previous studies about Vue.js and even try the setup syntax, it also made me try to find creative ways to perform the operations and theme switching.

### Continued development

I'd like to learn more about web design and further my knowledge in Vue.js and other libraries.
